# PageReplacementVisualization
A simulation of an operating system's page replacement system. Used to help students visualize high level operating systems concepts.

I seem to have misplaced the model.js and controller.js files, which unfortunately have all of the main logic. I will add them if I find them. In the meantime, PDFs of the files can be found under the PDFs folder. This is also what holds my final report that I turned in.
